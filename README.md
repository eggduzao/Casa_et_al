# **Casa et al. Redundant and specific roles of cohesin STAG subunits in chromatin looping and transcription control.**

This repository contains the *in house* computational scripts in python, R and shell that were used in the study by Casa et al.:
Redundant and specific roles of cohesin STAG subunits in chromatin looping and transcription control.

The scripts were tested and can be executed in a Unix and MAC OS environments.
This Mini-tutorial explains how to execute each particular analysis.

To be released.

## Installation

The first step is to have Python and R installed. Most Unix and MAC distributions already have this

programming languages installed. If you do not have them installed please visit:

- https://www.python.org/

- https://www.r-project.org/

### Dependencies

When installing this software, all its dependencies will be automatically installed.
If you encounter any problem. Please find bellow you will find the quickest way to install all the dependencies:

```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose
pip install --user pysam
pip install --user pyBigWig
pip install deeptools
sudo apt-get install unzip
curl https://github.com/samtools/samtools/releases/download/1.9/samtools-1.9.tar.bz2
tar xjf samtools-1.9.tar.bz2
cd samtools-1.9
./configure --prefix=/where/to/install
make
make install
```

The program also requires a couple of R packages. After a successful installation of R please type:

```
R
install.packages(c("MASS", "OneR", "RColorBrewer", "colorspace", "ggplot2", "ggthemes", "gplots", "lattice", "plot3D", "plotly", "plotrix", "reshape", "scatterplot3d"))
```

### Casa et al. scripts

Casa et al.'s scripts are made available to be executed as stand-alone scripts.

Please refer to **Usage Example** below for a description on how to execute each specific analysis.
